PhishGuard - Modern URL Phishing Analyzer

PhishGuard is a sophisticated yet easy-to-use tool designed to protect users from phishing attacks. It features a stunning, modern frontend with a dynamic particle background and a professional "glassmorphism" interface.

The core of the application is a lightweight Python (Flask) backend that uses a local, rule-based engine to analyze URLs in real-time. By avoiding external API dependencies, PhishGuard is fully self-contained, works offline, and is incredibly easy to set up and demonstrate.
